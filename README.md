# Music-Genre-Classification
This project presents research on music genre recognition. Getting this task done by deep learning models is affordable in terms of time and cost. I obtained a visual data set by converting the mel frequency values from a 2-second part of the music to mel-spectrograms by extracting the attributes for the training of the model for the Turkish music I chose. By training the Convolutional Neural Network Model with these images, 10 different types of classification were made in the previously untested Turkish music field.

All our music data was sourced from the most popular music of their genre by researching websites. There are 150 of each of the 10 genres, a total of 1500 pieces of data in mp3 format. These data are 60-70-80-90 with the help of 'librosa' library. A total of 6000 data were obtained by subtracting the mel-spectrogram of 2 seconds from the second. The reason for taking 2 seconds is to reach the result as soon as a small part of the music played in the application area is obtained, or to divide the music into all parts and take the general result from the different results to reach more accurate results. The values of 11025, 22050 and 44100 were tested as sampling rates. In the obtained results, it was found that the sampling rate of 44100 was the best value.
