# Music-Genre-Classification
This article presents research on music genre recognition. This is a very important task for today's technology because online music sharing has reached the size of millions of music and is increasing day by day. Getting this task done by deep learning models is affordable in terms of time and cost. I obtained a visual data set by converting the mel frequency values from a 2-second part of the music to mel-spectrograms by extracting the attributes for the training of the model for the Turkish music I chose. By training the Convolutional Neural Network Model with these images, 10 different types of classification were made in the previously untested Turkish music field.
